**About CouponHub**

CouponHub is a platform that lets you swap your unused/unuseful coupons obtained from various UPI payment platforms for ones that maybe useful to you.It's simple - everytime you post a coupon, you earn one platform credit and you can use your platform credits to buy coupons from our platform.

Our vision is to make a trustworthy platform that people turn to before buying any product/subscription/service etc, to search for discount coupons/vouchers. That being said, as we do not have a way of verifying the authenticity of coupons posted, we strongly depend on the discretion of the users. We have a reporting mechanism in place - if you come across a fake/expired coupon you report it. The user who posted the coupon gets a warning. If a user is reported 3 times for posting a fake coupon, their account gets blacklisted and they lose access to CouponHub until further notice.

_Help us keep CouponHub spam free, trustworthy and authentic :)_
